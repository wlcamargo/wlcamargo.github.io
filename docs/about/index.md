# About Me

![Imagemi](./images/me.png)

In 2019, I began working with Power BI and SQL Server, transitioning Excel reports to Business
Intelligence (BI) solutions. In 2020 I became a BI Analyst with a focus on building strategic, but
also tactical and operational dashboards. In 2022 I started in the world of big data and all the
technologies in this framework have been my main focus of learning and evolution at the
moment, as well as the concept of modern data stack.
